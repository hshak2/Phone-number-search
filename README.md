## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilized a public API to deliver results that are rendered to the document. Used JavaScript and HTML/CSS to make a mobile-first website.

## Lessons Learned:
Originally, I didn't add much to the styling of this site and opted for a normalized CSS structure with nothing else added. But I recently had decided to add minimal styling to make things look a bit more presentable. I decided to go against adding Tailwind CSS since this was a relatively simple site and I didn't feel that I needed to overcomplicate things with it. API implementation was relatively simple. However, since the API is free to use, it only provides you the ability to use it 100 times per month or so. This is fine for a static site that doesn't get used to often, so I don't intend to change it. I might add additional styling and functionality at a later point.
